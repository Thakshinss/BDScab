## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds
- **Email Service**: EmailJS for client-side email functionality

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Runtime**: Node.js with ES modules
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM configured for PostgreSQL
- **Session Storage**: In-memory storage with interface for future database integration
- **Development**: Hot reload with Vite middleware integration

### Database Strategy
- **Current**: In-memory storage implementation (MemStorage class)
- **Future**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM (schema already defined)
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for schema management

## Key Components

### Frontend Structure
- **Pages**: Home, Results, and 404 Not Found
- **Components**: 
  - Search form with validation
  - Car showcase and selection
  - Booking modal with customer details
  - Responsive header and footer
  - Toast notifications
- **UI Library**: Complete shadcn/ui component set for consistent design

### Backend Structure
- **Storage Interface**: Abstracted CRUD operations for users
- **Route Handler**: Centralized API route registration
- **Development Tools**: Request logging and error handling middleware

### Core Features
- **Vehicle Search**: Location-based search with date/time selection
- **Car Selection**: Multiple vehicle types (sedan, SUV, mini, tempo traveler)
- **Booking Process**: Customer details collection and confirmation
- **Email Notifications**: Automated booking confirmations via EmailJS
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with adaptive layouts

## Data Flow

1. **Search Process**: User enters pickup/destination → Client validation → Navigate to results
2. **Vehicle Selection**: Display available cars → Calculate fares → Show booking options
3. **Booking Flow**: Collect customer details → Validate form → Send email confirmation
4. **State Management**: React Query handles async operations and caching

## External Dependencies

- **Icons**: Lucide React for consistent iconography
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Email Service**: EmailJS for client-side email delivery

### Backend Dependencies
- **Database**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **ORM**: Drizzle with type-safe database operations
- **Validation**: Zod schemas for runtime type checking
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL session store (connect-pg-simple)

### Development Tools
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety across frontend and backend
- **ESBuild**: Fast bundling for production builds
- **Replit Integration**: Development environment with cartographer plugin

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
1. **Frontend**: Vite builds React app to `dist/public`
2. **Backend**: ESBuild bundles server code to `dist/index.js`
3. **Database**: Drizzle migrations applied via `npm run db:push`

### Environment Configuration
- **Development**: Local server with Vite middleware and HMR
- **Production**: Express serves static files with API routes
- **Database**: Environment variable `DATABASE_URL` for connection

### Runtime Environment
- **Node.js**: ES modules with modern JavaScript features
- **Session Persistence**: PostgreSQL-backed session storage
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error middleware with logging

The application is designed with scalability in mind, using interfaces that allow easy migration from in-memory storage to persistent database solutions. The modular architecture supports feature additions and maintenance through clear separation of concerns.
